# Postfix MTA PCRE Settings
###############################################################################
# Postfix attempts to be fast, easy to administer, and secure. The outside has
# a definite Sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is completely different.
#
# Configure postfix settings. When the same parameter is defined multiple
# times, only the last instance is remembered. Otherwise, the order of main.cf
# parameter definitions does not matter.
#
# postconf commands never report changed. postconf does not return any
# information on whether a line was or was not changed via exit codes or
# verbose mode. Force execute a postfix reload after configuration is set.
# Queries for UID/GID do not change system.
#
# To ensure service additions/deletions; master.cf is cleared before modifying,
# so default services are included in this configuration even if unchanged.
#
# postfix must be reloaded to pickup changes in main.cf.
#
# Manages pcre based checks.
